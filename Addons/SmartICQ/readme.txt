 < I N T R O D U C A T I O N >

  Hello, you are now using the probably first released icq client for mIRC.
  It does currenly not support file transfers and icq chat and a couple of
  other icq features that i felt was not needed. The main goal with this
  icq client for mirc was to make it smaller, faster and simplier to use
  than the real icq client. It's also possible to import your contact list,
  add contacts without their confirmation and alot of other features.
  If you don't like the look of it you can easily change it's apperance by
  changing to another skin or make your own skin.
  If you got an idea or found a bug - don't hesitate to e-mail me at 
  tronicer@freebox.com or visit us on irc at irc.digitalperk.net #smarticq.
  I would also like to thank all people who helped me in the developement of
  this addon. 
 
  Later,
  - tronicer

  SmartICQ has a feature that makes it really simple to connect and chat in #SmartICQ.

   [settings] -> Help -> Visit #SmartICQ
 
  That will open a new single window that will connect to irc.yourirc.net and join
  #SmartICQ for you. Really simple, try it.

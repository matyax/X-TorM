Q: How do i install it?
A: - Extract the ZIP into your mIRC directory.
   - Start mIRC.
   - Type "/load -rs smarticq\smarticq.mrc".
   - Type "/icq" or "/smarticq".

Q: I tried registering a new account and it never got past "Getting UIN..."?
A: Make sure you're not connected to icq through another client - this is one of the reasons 
   that can halt the registering process. If it still doesn't work, try change your password to 
   something else. It will also not work if you're behind a firewall of some sort..

Q: Can i import my contact list to SmartICQ?
A: Yes, you can. Follow these steps: (you must use mIRC v6.0x)
   - open the preferences dialog.
   - click on "plug-in manager".
   - load "import.smarticq-plugin.mrc".
   - close the preferences dialog.
   - click on "settings".
   - goto "plugins".
   - click on "import contact list".

Q: How do i install a skin?
A: - Choose a skin and download it.
   - Save it in your SmartICQ/skins/ directory (make sure the filename ends with .skin and 
     not .zip - very important).
   - Open up the preferences dialog.
   - Select the skin in the list and press [Load].

Q: Will you add MSN or AIM?
A: Heh, maybe. But probably not.

Q: I've found a bug, what should i do?
A: E-mail a description of it to tronicer@freebox.com.

Q: When upgrading, can i just unzip the files over the old files?
A: Yes, it won't remove your settings or anything. Just be sure that mIRC isn't running.
   SO REMEMBER - EXIT mIRC FIRST AND THEN UNZIP THE FILES!!!!!

Q: Could you script something for me?
A: No, don't have time..

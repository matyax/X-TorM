(actual version 2.077's notes will be found after scrolling down a bit)
old: 
iChess v2.0       (for mIRC 6.03 and higher, 5.91 will work as well.. i think)
---------------

aye, this is supposed to be a little help file, listing the main functions
of the script... and stuff one better knows to run it..
i unfortunately didnt keep track of version updates, so the current version
is rather a guess and only defined to make it easier to see whether an update
is available. I shall try to list news and fixes for new versions from now on
though.

oh ya... my name is Oliver.. bugreports and suggestions are welcome, if not
on IRC, an email to x_or@gmx.net will do =D

Installation: 
-----------------
              quite trivial, actually (or should be)
              firstly: unzip the file (ichess.zip) into a folder called "ichess"
              in your mIRC folder (of course you can pick another foldername
              but i will suppose you picked "ichess" while explaining)
              secondly: you only need to load the file "ichess.mrc", thats
              done by typing 
                               /load -rs1 ichess/ichess.mrc
              
              it tries to load it into the first position of the process order
              i suggest this, because experience showed that some silly scripts
              try to handle socket connections they have nothing to do with, so
              this will catch the events first. if you know what you are doing, 
              of course you can load it into any position, if need be

              err yeah.. if that doesnt work.. check again whether the program
              you are using is called "mIRC" and not "Pirch" or "Internet
              Explorer"...

Starting:
--------------

yeah well after loading.. /ichess [nick] will request a connection to the specified
nickname.. after that connection is established, both users should see a window
with a chessboard among other things

Note: if you are behind a firewall and cant get incoming connections on port 221
      (the one ichess standardwise uses) you can specify a port in the call, example:
      "/ichess ChessNinja 736" to host it on port 736

Menus:
-------------

the right-click menu and submenus in that window should be pretty self-explaining
requesting a Game is done under "Game" (i really put lots of thought into the
menu-names) such a request (as well as all other requests) are simply answered
by typing "ok" or "no" (without the ") in the entry-field of the window. 

Under Rules, you will find "Allow Undo".. trying to "Undo" will still only be a
request and the opponent has to accept it, but if it is disabled all Undo-requests
will be auto-declined.

if you want to set a Time-limit, a dialog will ask for the length, number of seconds or
a format like "hours:mins:seconds" will work, the opponent has to accept it.

Settings:
-----------

 Allow Single-Click-Moves: normally you need to drag and drop a piece to move, if
                           this option is enabled you also can singleclick on a piece
                           and then singleclick on the field to go

 Show valid moves: humm if this is disabled the script wont color the fields you can
                   move to, after clicking a piece, if enabled.. *gasps*... it will!

 Show chess-clocks: yeah.. guess.

 show clock as countdown: if a timelimit is enabled this will show the remaining time 
                           each player has, if not it will show  the time it normally

 Update: will download the newest update and install it (only the ichess.mrc, though
         if the DLL changes, i will either try to let it send the dll as well or make 
         an update available)

 Piecesets: lets ye pick a pieceset.. if you want to paint your own, just look at 
            the bitmaps, name it in the same way "ichess_pieces_[setname].bmp"

 Fieldsets: lets ye pick a fieldset.. if you want to paint your own, just look at 
            the bitmaps, name it in the same way "ichess_fields_[setname].bmp"

 Boardbitmap: lets ye pick.. etc. "ichess_boards_[name].bmp" will be the filename
              this will render a bitmap transparently into the background of the board

 Boardbitmap-dominance: sets the percentage at which the background will be seen,
                        trying out different settings here depending on the background
                        and the fieldset can produce nice results.               


Other stuff:
------------

theeeeen there is a lil item called "Forfeit" so if the ship is sinking.. *nods*

right below that.. you have the option to open the content of the chat-window in
the notepad.. either keeping the control-/colorcodes or stripping them.. to save
it as log or copy it or something
(before anyone asks: no i cannot make it let you mark/copy/paste the content, as
it is completely graphics... and writing this manually would be way too huge and 
slow as well ;P)

ECO:
------

ECO means "Encyclopedia of Chess Openings" a click on this item will show all openings
of the database matching the currently played opening, this wont find many matches
in most played openings and middle-games, however.. it can be used to analyze an opening
or get a good move-suggestion, i dont feel the need for making it possible to disable
this feature.. for it will rarely be used and mainly something *I* wanted to add
(was hard enough to build the database) and a single move suggestion in the opening
wont win a game :))

Undo-ing:
-----------

it is possible to re-store any state in the game for both sides by rightclicking on
a move in the history in the nicklist of the window and choosing the menuitem, or
double-clicking on the move that the board should be restored AFTER.
white will always undo to a state after a black move, black will always undo to a state
after a black move... i hope this does make sense after a few tries or so.

Moving: (or.. how to move my mouse.)
---------------------------------------

single-click on a piece shows the validmoves it can do (or not, if the option is
turned off), double-click on a field shows all possible attacker-fields.. careful
with that one though, if you enabled single-click-moves this might cause an accidental
move. to actually move a piece, drag and drop is used.

Did i apologize for the structure of this file, or the fact that said structure
is lacking? however.. i hope that most options are explained and there are no 
questions left, if there are.. the email address is at the top of the file

/updateichess is the command used to update it, it *should* work automatically 

you can also change the font and fontsize in the ichess.ini, i didnt make that an
option in the script, so.. change it manually :D, ill add the option to change
the colors.. maybe.. someday.

the current rating and game-statistics are not yet available as option in the script
or something, but you can type //say $showchessstats.. if you must :P (yes, 3 's's)

thats all, i think..

the script does have a computer-opponent.. however.. its not released here and would
need the second dll containing the "AI".. the problem was that it froze mIRC for about
2 minutes while thinking 4 moves deep, fancy optimizing using hashtables for chess-
situations and whatnot seem to be quite a bit of work to work with a dll and tries to
let the dll run a second "thinking" thread in the background while the user can chat
were successful, however: resulted in an odd exception after 10 minutes or so of idling.
this probably due to the lack of my coding abilities. if anyone wants the dll to play
against Chob (his name :D) i can send it.

============================================================================

Update to v2.077
---------------------

In short, the new options are: stripping the colors from the chat-lines (for
those who have problems with em), turning on/off the beeping, make it open
all windows as desktop windows, turn on/off the sorting of captured pieces
(if turned off they will appear in the order they got captured) 

New features:
-----------------

is is now possible to run a server that watchers or potential players can
connect to, also the host of the board can kick users and ban IP-masks, or
set the whole board to "mute" (+m, if you will, you IRC fanatics, you.), so
only the owner of the thing can talk (supposed to keep the board quiet if
a serious game is happening).. users still connected, but matching a banned
IP-masks will not be able to chat or send requests/events of any sort (hence
await the kick or get the message.)

the update system is finally quite decent.. it now checks for the version
before updating.. giving my box a bit of time to do things for ME.. instead of
sending everybody the version they already have 24/7 :\

a little stats-thing is built in now, so a huge list of played games can be
populated.. its turn off-able if someone doesnt want this.. but i would
suggest to keep it in, since it is interesting and makes for good statistics :)

to view those go to http://xor.ma.cx/ichess same address for adding "public"
servers and comments, etc. (will also have new version news)

a CPU-player is now added and works.. (still beta, please report bugs or
suggestions) it doesnt state "thinking" yet.. ill add that soonish...
just consider it thinking if its time runs... in RARE cases there might have 
been a timeout or so.. (maybe 10 mins.. shouldnt happen) in that case just
undo the last move (really the last line, so it wont actually undo anything)
then itll hopefully wake up again :P

im not completely happy with this chess-service, but it works and is quite fast
and quite a tough opponent, for more info: http://www.danmarinescu.com/
thanks m0rph^/m0rpheus, who pointed that service out to me and also wrote the
main php to retrieve the stuff.
if i get to finish Chob and make it faster, ill compile it as cgi and do a similar
trick to get the next move.. until then have fun with RCPU.


Small command-list:
--------------------------
just in short, some commands in compressed form:

  /ichess [nick] [port]  - request starting a session with <nick> on port [port]
                           both are optional, standard port is 222
                           if no <nick> is given, you will be the only one on 
                           the board and can play against yourself or RCPU
                           Note: in this mode you can NOT invite other people or
                           run a server

  /ichessjoin <host> <port>  - connect to an iChess-server, both parameters
                               are needed

 inside the session/board:

  /me                    - /me slaps you for even wondering

  /clear                 - clears the chat-stuff
  
  /who                   - lists all users currently on the board (with ratings)

  /invite <nick> [port]  - invite <nick> to the board, must be host of it
                           port is again optional, standard is 222
                           Note: same as inviting through the Host-menu

  aliases:

   $showchessstats     - shows your complete record, if no parameters are given
                         if you specify nick names or parts of nicknames, itll
                         only spit out the stats for all games against those
                         matching nicks (can specify more than one, speparated
                         by spaces)    

  (still no real alias or so for this, maybe later.. but at least the streak
   bugs and the like should be fixed now)


That's All. (i think.. yet again.)

Ah. one addition: if you want to change your nick inside the game, change it in
"ichess.ini", where it is stored.. this is only done to keep a "static" nick
in all those record.stats, and assures you always are the same in there, network
and IRC-nick independent.

<a name="1"><a>Introduction
<p>Here comes my second version from my MSN Messenger client for mIRC. This time, the update isn't just a few bug fixes, but mainly consist in a total recoding of
the addon! This version now supports multi-users conversation, emoticons, file receiving
(still in development), a multilingual support, the creation of conversation theme allowing the use of tags, and a lots of other function like the traditional
Appear Offline status at the connection. This addon uses MSNP9 protocol, the same used by MSN Messenger 6.0, the first version of the addon uses MSNP7, a version of the
protocol which isn't supported anymore. I'd like to thank a few people, what I'll do in the credits section at the bottom of the page. For any question regarding this addon,
please contact me by email.
<br><hr>
<a name="2"><a>Configurations
<p><u>General tab</u><br>
<br>› You can connect with an Appear Offline, something we can't do with MSN Messenger, so your contacts won't see that you just connected.<br>
› When you're connecting, your contacts are added in groups in the treeview that are closed, to see contacts while adding them, you can activate the option to open the contact
groups.<br>› This version of MSNMIRC supports wav sounds, so you can activate them when you receive a message or when someone goes online.<br>
› The notify window that notifies you when a contact goes online can have two design, one with a 3D border like in MS Windows, or a simple black line as a contour,
you can also choose how long the window will remain open until it automatically closes.<br>›For opening the popup menu, you can choose either to have
a mouse right click or left click in order to open it.<br>› Finally, multilingual support! You can change the language of the addon whenever you want.
<br><br>
<u>Conversation tab</u><br>
<br>› The option to send a message with bold characters, this will only be showed in bold on the screen of your contact.<br>› Between each message, you have the choice to skip a line or not to
better follow the conversation.<br>› Each conversation is stocked as an HTML file, you have the choice to keep them or to delete them.<br>› At the opening of
a conversation, you can automatically put it in the taskbar, which can help you not fill up the screen with conversation window when you're away
and that you're still connected to MSNMIRC.<br>› When you're away on IRC, MSNMIRC can follow mIRC and reply to your contact automatically with the same message as your away on IRC.<br>
› In the configuration of your conversation theme again, you can choose to show the email address of the contact or his nickname.<br>› If you check the box to create your own conversation
theme, you can, with the help of HTML and pre-formatted tags, a theme you really like. For the tags list, please refer to the next section of the help file, just below.
<br><br>
<a name="tags"><a>Tags
<p>To show the time: &lt;time&gt;<br>
To show the nickname or the email address of the contact: &lt;nick&gt;<br><br>
You can also add HTML tags like &lt;b&gt;, &lt;u&gt;, &lt;br&gt;, &lt;font&gt;, etc..
<br><hr>
<a name="3"><a>Connection
<p>To connect, I've create a shortcut key, you can press F4, or choose it from the popup menu. You only have to fill the edit box with
your complete email address and your password you use to connect to MSN Messenger. The main dialog should automatically open after that.
If the connection seems very slow, it's normally due to Passport.NET, with which I frequently meet some slow connection
or a server being down, so I can't fix this problem, it's the samething as MSN Messenger and I have to use this server.
<br><hr>
<a name="4"><a>Main dialog
<p>Your contacts will be located in the different contact groups, double click on the group to open or close it. Then you can use the popup
menu to manage your contacts, to chat with them, or to see their MSN profil. The menus located at the top of the dialog gets you a fast
access to some main commands like the configurations of the addon or tools to manage your contacts.
<br><hr>
<a name="5"><a>Conversation
<p>To send a message, write down your message in the edit box located at the bottom of the dialog, and press the Enter key to send it. To add an emoticon to your message, click
on the button located at the right of the Send button, Then click on the emoticon you want to add. The User List tab will give you the list
of the users participating to the conversation, so the one that will receive your messages. To invite a contact, go in the tab from the same name
and choose a contact, then click on the Invite button, in the conversation, if the invitation was received successfully, you'll see him join. To print the
current conversation, click on the Print button located at the top right corner of the dialog.
<br><hr>
<a name="6"><a>File receiving
<p>This isn't finished, so you can meet some problems while receiving a file.<br><br>When a contact tries to send you a file, you'll get a notice, and
you can either accept or reject it. If you accept it, you won't see the file downloading progress, so you can ask the person who is sending you the file
if you want some information on how it goes. But, when the file has finished downloading, you'll be notify if the download has failed or not.
<br><hr>
<a name="7"><a>Credits
<p>This addon was thinked, coded then recoded by Artwerks. First, I want to thank Nightmare who supported me during the coding period, beta tested the file and
also gived me a lot of good ideas. For the file receiving, my code being too slow due to the slowliness of mIRC, sax has coded me a dll
dll qui that does the samething as my code, but in only a few milliseconds, instead of the tens of seconds mIRC had to take, so it's greatly appreciated!
I also thank everyone who has tested the addon and those who commented my screenshots to give me some ideas. To contact me, please refer
to the About dialog in the addon.<br><br>Thank you, positive feedbacks and suggestions are welcome.

v2.075 - 12.03.2003

bugfixes:
 - user-list handling, rewritten
 - several minor bugs in watching mode (wrong time running,
   wrong turn-indicator under certain circumstances)
 - black background now also if the standard background isnt black
 
news:
 - now possible to run a server
 - in addition to the server, the new alias /ichessjoin [host] [port]
 - host can invite/kick/ban IP-masks and set the board to "mute"
 - option to open all windows as desktop window
 - option to strip colorcodes from the chat (if needed)
 - option to turn beeping on/off for moves and events
 - option to disable sorting of the captured pieces (then appearing in the
   order they were captured
 - finally the possibility to continue a game once a disconnected
   player is back.. without saving and loading the game
 - update-system now checks whether an update is needed before getting it
 - check will no longer color the whole history-line red, only the half-move
   which caused it
 - added a cpu-opponent (thanks to m0rph^/m0rpheus for the idea to use
   the online service found at <a href=http://www.danmarinescu.com/>http://www.danmarinescu.com/, he also did
   most of the PHP needed to retrieve the moves, i only changed the stuff
   to add some functions i needed), the AI/engine used for this is not
   mine (hence the url given above), but i will try to finish Chob and then
   add him, too.
